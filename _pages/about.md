My name is Samira Hobi and I am a second year Master student in Digital Linguistics at the University of Zurich. I have a strong interest in Low Resource languages, their documentation, digitisation and ethical issues related to these endeavours. If you are interested in this, too, I highly recommend checking out [this project](https://www.barngarla.com).
