My name is Samira Hobi and I am a second year Master student in Digital Linguistics at the University of Zurich. I have a strong interest in Low Resource languages, their documentation, digitisation and ethical issues related to these endeavours. If you are interested in this too, I highly recommend checking out [this project](https://www.barngarla.com). 
Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
